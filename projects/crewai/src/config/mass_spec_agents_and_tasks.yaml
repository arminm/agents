  data_processing:
    description: >
      Process raw mass spectrometry data. Perform peak detection, peptide identification, and protein quantification using standard proteomics workflows. You don't need the raw mass spectrometry data. Just use the available data and focus on one cell samples that are named in this format: MCF7Kelly1c_*
    expected_output: >
      Processed dataset with identified proteins, their quantities, and quality metrics.

  differential_analysis:
    description: >
      Conduct differential expression analysis between each condition group. Identify significantly changed proteins and perform pathway enrichment analysis.
    expected_output: >
      List of differentially expressed proteins, statistical analysis results, and enriched pathways.
